## Overview
Livepeer Pipelines allows you to apply AI-generated visual effects to live video streams. This tutorial will walk you through trying a pipeline, and suggest some next steps in your journey.

## Getting Started

### 1. Basic Configuration

#### Source Setup
1. Go to the [Showcase App](https://pipelines.livepeer.org/)
2. Select the "Explore Pipelines" in the menu on the left
3. Select a Pipeline
4. In the "Source" dropdown menu, select "Webcam" as your input source
5. The interface will display two viewing windows:
   - Left window: Stream source preview
   - Right window: Processed output preview

#### Prompt Configuration
Many pipelines have text prompts. If you're using one that does:
1. Locate the "Prompt" text field
2. Enter descriptive terms that define the visual style you want to apply
3. Example prompt formatting:
   ```
   talking head, cyberpunk, tron, matrix, ultra-realistic, dark, futuristic, neon, 8k
   ```

You may also encounter X:Y coordinate selection.

### 3. Advanced Settings
- Click the "Advanced Settings" dropdown to access additional configuration options
- Use these settings to fine-tune pipeline behavior

## Operating the Pipeline

### Start your video
1. Allow camera and microphone permissions when prompted by your browser
2. The pipeline will automatically begin processing once it detects the input stream. This may take up to a minute.

### Real-time Controls
1. Use the "Save Parameters" button to apply any changes to your prompt or settings
2. Monitor both preview windows to see the effects of your changes
3. Click "View pipeline info" to see detailed pipeline information
4. Streams in this view are ephemeral and cannot be accessed after the browser window is closed. You can click "Create stream" to create a persistent stream that can be used to livestream to social channels
5. [optional] If prompted by the Livepeer support team, use the "Copy logs" button to access logs for debugging


## Best Practices

### Prompt Writing
- Use comma-separated terms
- Combine style descriptors (e.g., "cyberpunk", "futuristic")
- Include technical quality terms (e.g., "8k", "ultra-realistic")
- Layer complementary concepts (e.g., "dark" with "neon")

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. If stream appears offline:
   - Verify your source connection
   - Check that your stream settings match your source
   - Wait for automatic playback to begin

2. If effects aren't appearing as expected:
   - Review and adjust your prompt
   - Check Advanced Settings
   - Ensure you've clicked "Save parameters" after making changes
