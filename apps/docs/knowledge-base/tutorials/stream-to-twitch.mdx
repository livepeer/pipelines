## Prerequisites
* Follow the steps in the [Create Stream tutorial](/knowledge-base/tutorials/create-a-stream) to create a new stream


## Step 1: Access Twitch Inspector
Go to the [Twitch Inspector website](https://inspector.twitch.tv) and log in with your Twitch account credentials.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Stream
* In a new tab, go to your Twitch Creator Dashboard.
* Navigate to Settings > Stream to find your Stream Key and RTMP ingest URL
* Copy the RTMP URL & Stream Key, append `?bandwidthtest=true` to the end, and paste the full URL into the "Destination URL" field of your stream on Livepeer.

## Step 3: Start a Stream Test
* In Twitch Inspector, click the Run a Stream Test button.

## Step 4: Stream and Monitor
[Start streaming with OBS](/knowledge-base/tutorials/stream-into-pipeline-OBS). Twitch Inspector will begin receiving your stream data.

In Twitch Inspector, confirm that the stream output is what you expect. You can also use this to preview changes to pipeline parameters.

##Step 5: Final Check & Real Stream
Once your stream test looks stable in Twitch Inspector:

* Stop the stream in OBS
* In Livepeer, remove `?bandwidthtest=true` from the Stream Key.
* Start your actual live stream
