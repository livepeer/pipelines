## Prerequisites

* Follow the steps in the [Create Stream tutorial](/knowledge-base/tutorials/create-a-stream) to create a new stream

## Step 1: Access Twitch Inspector

* Go to the [Twitch Inspector website](https://inspector.twitch.tv) and log in with your Twitch account credentials.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Stream

* In a new tab, go to your Twitch Creator Dashboard.

* Navigate to Settings > Stream to find your Stream Key and RTMP ingest URL

* Copy the RTMP URL & Stream Key, and add `?bandwidthtest=true` to the end, creating a URL like `rtmp://live.twitch.tv/app/<stream_key>?bandwidthtest=true`

* Taste the full URL into the "Stream Target" field of your stream on Livepeer.

## Step 3: Start a Stream Test

* In Twitch Inspector, click the Run a Stream Test button.

## Step 4: Stream and Monitor

* [Start streaming with OBS](/knowledge-base/tutorials/stream-into-pipeline-OBS). Twitch Inspector will begin receiving your stream data. Please be patient as this may take up to 90 seconds.

* In Twitch Inspector, confirm that the stream output is what you expect. You can also use this to preview changes to pipeline parameters.

## Step 5: Final Check & Real Stream

* Once your stream test looks stable in Twitch Inspector, stop the stream in OBS

* In Livepeer, remove `?bandwidthtest=true` from the Stream Key.

* Start your actual live stream
