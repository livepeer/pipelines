## Step 2: Select a pipeline
Search for your desired pipeline. You can browse all pipelines on the [Explore page](https://pipelines.livepeer.org/explore).

## Step 3: Name your stream and define the output 

Once you've selected your desired pipeline, give your stream a name and specify the URL where you'd like to push the output. We've also created tutorials for setting up push to [Twitch](/knowledge-base/tutorials/stream-to-twitch), [Youtube](/knowledge-base/tutorials/stream-to-youtube), and [X](/knowledge-base/tutorials/stream-to-x).

Please see our OBS guide [here](/knowledge-base/tutorials/stream-into-pipeline-obs).

## Step 5: Tweak stream parameters and observe updates 

You can access stream parameters through the settings popup.
