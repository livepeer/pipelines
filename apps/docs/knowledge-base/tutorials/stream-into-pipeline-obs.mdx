Before you begin, you'll need:

* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) installed on your computer
* [A stream created](/create-a-stream.mdx)

## Step 2: Configure OBS

1. Open OBS Studio

2. Click the "+" under Sources and add your video source:

   - For webcam: Select "Video Capture Device"

   - For screen capture: Select "Display Capture"

## Step 2: Set up streaming settings

1. Click "Settings" → "Stream"

2. For "Service" select "Custom..."

3. Set "Server" to your `rtmpIngestUrl`, copied from the [Livepeer Pipelines app](https://pipelines.livepeer.org/streams/my-streams)

4. Set "Stream Key" to your `streamKey`, copied from the [Livepeer Pipelines app](https://pipelines.livepeer.org/streams/my-streams)

5. Click "Apply"

## Step 3 (optional): Add an Audio delay

1. In the Audio Mixer panel (at the bottom of the OBS interface), locate the audio source you want to adjust. This might be your microphone, desktop audio, or another audio input.

2. Click the gear icon next to the audio source in the Audio Mixer.

3. From the dropdown menu, select Filters.

4. In the Filters window, click the + button at the bottom-left corner and select Audio Delay (Sync Offset) from the list of available filters.

5. A new filter will appear in the list. Set the delay in milliseconds (ms) - positive values delay the audio. Start with a small delay, such as 200ms, and adjust incrementally until the audio and video are synchronized on the distribution platform.


## Step 4: Start streaming

1. Click "Start Streaming" in OBS

2. Your stream should begin within 30-45 seconds

3. View your stream at the `playbackUrl`. You can also use the hosted Livepeer player to view the stream, at `https://lvpr.tv/?v=<playbackID>`

## Common issues

- **Black screen**: Check that your video source is properly selected and visible in OBS

- **Connection failed**: Verify your stream key and RTMP URL are correct

- **High CPU usage**: Lower your video output resolution in OBS Settings → Video
