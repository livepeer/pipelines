## Install Nodes in ComfyUI
When adding custom nodes, you will need to install them in both `comfyui` and `comfystream` conda environments.

<Note>Since ComfyUI is started in the `comfyui` environment, you can usually install nodes directly via **ComfyUI-Manager**. If you do this, you only need to [install the nodes for ComfyStream](#install-nodes-in-comfystream).</Note>

1. Change to the `custom_nodes` directory:

```bash
cd /ComfyUIcustom_nodes
```

2. Clone the node repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RealTimeNodes.git
cd ComfyUI_RealTimeNodes
```
<Info>
[ComfyUI_RealTimeNodes](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RealTimeNodes) is a collection of over 100 custom nodes for ComfyUI! Many can be used with ComfyStream to create custom workflows for real-time video processing.
</Info>

3. Activate the `comfyui` environment and install requirements:
```bash
conda activate comfyui
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Proceed to [Install nodes for ComfyStream](#install-nodes-in-comfystream) each time you add a new node to ComfyUI.

## Install Nodes in ComfyStream
After adding a custom node to ComfyUI, you must also install the dependencies in the `comfystream` environment:

1. Start a new terminal session and navigate to the comfystream directory

```bash
cd /ComfyStream
```

2. Activate the comfystream environments and install the custom node requirements. The `--workspace` flag should point to the directory for ComfyUI:

```bash
conda activate comfystream
python install.py --workspace ../ComfyUI
```

## Testing the Custom Node Installation
To validate the installation of a new node:
1. Start or restart ComfyUI after node installation
2. Monitor the logs on startup for any `IMPORT FAILED` message when loading the new node
3. Load or build a workflow that uses the new custom node
4. From ComfyUI, export the workflow for ComfyStream: **Workflow** > **Export (API)**
5. [Run ComfyStream](./run-comfystream) to use the workflow as a live AI video stream

## Installing Additional Custom Nodes

Refer to [Available ComfyUI Nodes](../../technical/reference/available-nodes) for installation steps and sample workflows for all supported nodes
