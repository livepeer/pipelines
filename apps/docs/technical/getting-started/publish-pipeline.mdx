# How to Publish a Pipeline

This guide will walk you through creating, configuring, and publishing a pipeline step by step.

## Before You Begin: Export Your ComfyUI Workflow JSON

Before creating a pipeline, youâ€™ll need to export your workflow JSON from ComfyUI:

1. **Open ComfyUI**:
   Launch ComfyUI and ensure your workflow is finalized.

2. **Export Workflow JSON**:
   Use the **Export (API)** option in ComfyUI to save your workflow as a JSON file.

3. **Save the File**:
   Keep the exported JSON file handy for upload during pipeline creation.

## Step 1: Create a New Pipeline

1. **Access the Pipeline Creation Page**:
   Navigate to the "Create Pipeline" interface.

2. **Fill in the Pipeline Details**:

   * **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your pipeline (e.g., *Live Portrait Generator*).

   * **Version**: Specify the version number (e.g., `1.0.0`).

   * **Description**: Provide a clear description of what your pipeline does and its use cases.

3. **Upload Assets**:

   * **Cover Image**: Upload an image that represents your pipeline.

   * **ComfyUI JSON**: Upload your pipeline's ComfyUI workflow JSON file.

4. **Proceed to the Next Step**:
   Click **Next** to move to parameter configuration.

## Step 2: Configure Parameters

1. **Select Key Parameters**:

   * Choose up to **5 important parameters** that should always be visible to users.

   * For each parameter:

     * **Node**: Select the relevant node.

     * **Field**: Choose the associated field.

     * **Display Name**: Provide a user-friendly name for the parameter.

     * **Description**: Explain what the parameter does.

     * **Widget Type**: Specify the input type (e.g., Text).

2. **Add Additional Parameters**:

   * Click **Add Parameter** to configure additional parameters as needed.

3. **Review Configuration**:
   Ensure all key parameters are accurately set up.

4. **Finalize**:
   Click **Create** to save and proceed to the validation step.

## Step 3: Validate and Publish the Pipeline

1. **Run Pre-Deployment Tests**:

   * The system will automatically validate your pipeline and benchmark its performance.

   * Results include metrics like:

     * **Average Framerate**: The frame rate achieved by your pipeline.

     * **Framerate Degradation**: Indicates any drops in performance.

     * **Status**: General pipeline validation status.

2. **Review Results**:
   Ensure all benchmarks meet your requirements.

3. **Publish the Pipeline**:
   Once the tests are complete and successful, click **Publish Pipeline** to make it live.

## Sharing your Pipeline

Congratulations! Your pipeline is now published and ready for use. For additional configurations or edits, revisit the pipeline settings.

To share your pipeline, you have two options:

* Simply share the link and let your friends try it themselves

* Navigate to [`https://pipelines.livepeer.org/stream/create`](https://pipelines.livepeer.org/stream/create), create a stream with your pipeline, and stream to your favorite social media platform.
