ComfyStream UI must be ran on a system with physical or virtual camera. In this guide we will install ComfyStream UI on a local machine

1. Clone ComfyStream UI:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yondonfu/comfystream
cd comfystream/ui
```
2.  Run the following command to install the project's dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
This will download and set up all required Node.js modules listed in the package.json file.
<Note>
If you run encounter packages install errors, check the installed versions of node:
`node -v && npm -v`

Switch to the correct node version if necessary: 
`nvm use 18`
</Note>

3. From the `comfystream/ui` directory, start ComfyStream UI:
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Obtaining the Stream URL

The **Stream URL** in ComfyStream UI should be set to the url and external port for the ComfyStream API environment.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="RunPod (Linux)">
        1. Log into RunPod and go the **Pods** page.
        2. Click on the **Connect** button.
        3. Click the **TCP Port Mappings** tab.
        4. Copy the *IP address* and *external port* for 8889, to create the url `http://IP:PORT`
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Local (Windows)">
        - Use `http://localhost:8889`
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Customizing the default stream URL
If you are not running ComfyStream UI on the same host as the ComfyStream API, you can customize the default stream URL to ease testing.

Create a new `.env` file with your running ComfyStream API URL:

```bash
cd comfystream/ui
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_STREAM_URL=http://10.10.10.1:8889" > .env
```

## Supported workflows
Refer to [Available ComfyUI Nodes](../../technical/reference/available-nodes) for sample workflows to import into ComfyStream and ComfyUI

<Note>Sample workflows are listed in the `examples` directory of most node repositories</Note>
