While executing a workflow many times per second presents unique challenges, it also opens up new opportunities. Modulating parameters over time is more straightforward than in ComfyUI's normal batch paradigm.

<Note>
The techniques described here are specific to real-time streaming workflows and may not work in standard ComfyUI batch processing.
</Note>

## Reactive Controls

### RealtimeNodes
RealtimeNodes were created specifically for ComfyStream and enable unique reactive behaviors. Used with [ComfyUI-Logic nodes](https://github.com/theUpsider/ComfyUI-Logic), they enable sophisticated control flows.

<Tip>
These nodes are under active development, with new features being added often. Feedback is welcome!
</Tip>

### Parameter Scheduling
Control any parameter of any ComfyUI node dynamically through scheduling:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ValueControl - Gradual changes over N frames">
    - `IntControl` - Integer value transitions
    - `FloatControl` - Floating point value transitions  
    - `StringControl` - String value transitions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SequenceControl - Cycle through preset values">
    - `IntSequence` - Cycle through integer values
    - `FloatSequence` - Cycle through float values
    - `StringSequence` - Cycle through string values
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Common use cases:
- Dynamic Controlnet parameter adjustment
- Automated LoRA effect cycling
- Cycling through prompts over time
- Triggering a certain prompt according to a condition

### Motion Detection 

<Warning>
MotionControl features are currently in experimental beta
</Warning>

- `ROI` - Define regions of interest in which motion detection is active
- `IntegerMotionController` - Trigger actions based on movement

Use cases:
- Motion-triggered mask intensity
- Dynamic parameter adjustment based on movement

### Tracking and Masking

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HandTracking">
    - `HandTrackingNode` - Track multiple hands
    - `HandMaskNode` - Generate masks for regions of those hands
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Interactive Masks">
    - `ResizeMaskNode` - Dynamic mask resizing based on proximity to an input mask
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Logic Control
- `LazyCondition` - Skip portions of a workflow conditionally
   
   Use cases:
   - Skip computationally expensive ControlNet processing when not needed
   - Output different images based on motion detection results
   - Switch between different processing paths based on input frame similarity

### Utility Nodes
- `FPSMonitor` - Performance overlay with image and mask output
- `QuickShapeMask` - Fast shape mask generation
- `DTypeConverter` - Convert between mask data types
- `FastWebcamCapture` - Optimized webcam input
- `SimilarityFilter` - Skip processing of similar frames

<Note>
Audio reactivity features are coming soon!
</Note>

### Advanced Examples
These are real-world examples of advanced usage of the above nodes and concepts.

<Info>
Example workflows demonstrating each feature can be found in the [ComfyUI_RealTimeNodes repository](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RealTimeNodes/tree/main/examples).
