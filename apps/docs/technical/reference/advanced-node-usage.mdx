Congratulations on completing your first pipeline! Now, let's explore a usage of some advanced nodes and features.

While executing a workflow many times per second presents unique challenges, it also opens up new opportunities. For instance, modulating parameters over time is more straightforward than in ComfyUI's normal batch paradigm.

## Reactive Controls

### RealtimeNodes
RealtimeNodes were created specifically for ComfyStream and enable unique reactive behaviors. Used in combination with [ComfyUI-Logic nodes](https://github.com/theUpsider/ComfyUI-Logic) and other nodes in the ecosystem, they enable sophisticated control flows.

<Tip>
These nodes are under active development, with new features being added often. Feedback is welcome!
</Tip>

### Parameter Scheduling
Control any parameter of any ComfyUI node dynamically through scheduling:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ValueControl - Gradual changes over N frames">
    - `IntControl` - Integer value transitions
    - `FloatControl` - Floating point value transitions  
    - `StringControl` - String value transitions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SequenceControl - Cycle through preset values">
    - `IntSequence` - Cycle through integer values
    - `FloatSequence` - Cycle through float values
    - `StringSequence` - Cycle through string values
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Common use cases:
- Dynamic Controlnet parameter adjustment
- Automated LoRA effect cycling
- Cycling through prompts over time
- Triggering a certain prompt according to a condition

Example:
- [Shape Resize Control](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RealtimeNodes/blob/main/examples/shape_resize_example_API.json) - Demonstrates transitioning the shape of a mask in a composite workflowusing FloatControl. This simple example demonstrates a concept that can be extrapolated to more complex behaviors.

### Motion Detection 

<Warning>
MotionControl features are currently in experimental beta
</Warning>

- `ROI` - Define regions of interest in which motion detection is active
- `IntegerMotionController` - Trigger actions based on movement

Use cases:
- Motion-triggered mask intensity
- Dynamic parameter adjustment based on movement

Examples:
- [Motion Detected Bluring](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RealtimeNodes/blob/main/examples/motioncontrol.json) - This example demonstrates using two regions of interest to trigger different behaviors. 
- [Motion Triggered Processing](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RealtimeNodes/blob/main/examples/on_off_example_api.json) - This example demonstrates using motion detection in combination with a logic node to acheive an 'on-off' effect.

### Tracking and Masking

<Warning>
Hand tracking features are currently in experimental beta
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HandTracking">
    - `HandTrackingNode` - Track multiple hands
    - `HandMaskNode` - Generate masks for regions of those hands
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Interactive Masks">
    - `ResizeMaskNode` - Dynamic mask resizing based on proximity to an input mask
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Example:
- [Hand Tracking with Dynamic Masks](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RealtimeNodes/blob/main/examples/hand_tracking_mask_resizer.json) - Demonstrates real-time hand tracking, as well as dynamic mask resizing based on the proximity of the hands to the mask.

### Logic Control
- `LazyCondition` - Skip portions of a workflow conditionally
   
   Use cases:
   - Skip computationally expensive ControlNet processing when not needed
   - Output different images based on motion detection results
   - Switch between different processing paths based on input frame similarity

Example:
- [Similarity Filter](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RealtimeNodes/blob/main/examples/similarity_filter_example_api.json) - This is a simple demonstration of a powerful technique, which allows for skipping a computationally expensive path in a workflow based on a condition.

### Utility Nodes
- `FPSMonitor` - Performance overlay with image and mask output
- `QuickShapeMask` - Fast shape mask generation
- `DTypeConverter` - Convert between mask data types
- `FastWebcamCapture` - Optimized webcam input
- `SimilarityFilter` - Skip processing of similar frames
- `StateResetNode` - Resets the state of all nodes in the workflow when triggered

<Note>
Audio reactivity features are coming soon!
