## Creating a new RunPod Account
1. Create a [RunPod.io](https://runpod.io) account, and add some funds.
2. Add a public key to your RunPod account **Settings** > **SSH Public Keys**.
### **Setting Up SSH Keys for RunPod**
To create an SSH keypair and use it to connect to a server on RunPod, follow these simple steps.

1. Start a session in Powershell or terminal of your choice, and run a command like the following:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
<Note>
This will generate a pair of files. For me, the files are `ryanrunpod`, and `ryanrunpod.pub`
</Note>

### Adding SSH to RunPod

Locate your public key file (the one that ends in .pub), open it in notepad, and copy the contents to the field pictured below in the settings of your RunPod account.

<Note>If you're adding this SSH key with a server running, you will need to start a new shell session for it to work!</Note>

SSH is now set up for your RunPod account, so you can use it with any servers you provision.

## Deploying a new RunPod server
1. From the **Pods** page, click **Deploy**
2. Select an appropriate GPU (ex: RTX 4090) and make the following changes:
    1. Click **Storage**, then **Network Volume**. Pick a suitable name, region, and size for the volume. You can add more size later if you run out. ![New Network Volume](../../images/networkvolume.png) <Warning>It is important to create a network volume, otherwise, your data will be lost when the server is stopped.</Warning>
    2. Click **Change Template**, select `Torch 2.4.0` <Note>Alternatively, you can choose this [RunPod template](https://runpod.io/console/deploy?template=6dj77fsqa8&ref=u8tlskew) which is pre-configured with the settings below</Note>
    3. Click **Edit Template**, set the ports:
        - **Expose HTTP Ports** to `8888,8188`
        - **Expose TCP Ports** to `22,8889`  ![Pod Template](../../images/podtemplate.png)
       
    4. Click **Set Overrides** to save the changes
5. Click **Deploy On-Demand**
6. Proceed to [Install Conda, ComfyUI, and ComfyStream](../develop-pipeline/local-testing)

## **Stopping a RunPod Server**
Stopping pods helps lower costs on RunPod. Pods must also be stopped before making any port mapping changes.

Refer to [Installing runpodctl](https://docs.runpod.io/runpodctl/install-runpodctl). If you're on windows, this can be installed on WSL also

Create an API key for your RunPod account, and add it to runpod-cli
```bash
runpodctl config --apiKey YOUR_API_KEY
```

To stop a server, run the following command:
```bash
 runpodctl stop pod YOUR_PODID
```
