### Prerequisites
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [ComfyStream_Setup_Scripts](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyStream_Setup_Scripts)


### Local Powershell Setup

We will use the [setup_comfystream.ps1](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyStream_Setup_Scripts/blob/main/local/setup_comfystream.ps1) Powershell script to automate install of conda environments for ComfyStream and ComfyUI.
<Info>
You may need to enable [script execution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.4)
```powershell (admin)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
</Info>

1. If you do not already have Conda, install it from an elevated powershell
```powershell (admin)
.\install_conda.ps1
```

2. It is optional, but recommended to initialize Conda in Powershell, then restart the terminal. This will show the active conda environment in the terminal prompt. 
```powershell
conda init powershell
```

3. Clone the ComfyStream Setup Scrips
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyStream_Setup_Scripts
cd ComfyStream_Setup_Scripts\local
```

4. Install ComfyStream, ComfyUI and related packages
```powershell (admin)
.\setup_comfystream.ps1
```

After running the script, you should see the following folders in your current working directory:
- **ComfyUI**
- **ComfyStream**

5. Create a Symbolic link to the models folder for both ComfyUI workspaces 
```powershell (admin)
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "$realtimePath\ComfyUI\models" -Target "$comfyUIPath\models"
```

6. Run ComfyUI
```powershell
cd ..\ComfyUI
conda activate comfyui
python main.py --listen
```

<Warning>
If you need to delete the conda environment and start over run the following commands:
```powershell
conda deactivate
conda remove --name comfystream --all
```
</Warning>
