New pipelines must pass pre-deployment tests before they can be published to Livepeer. 

**FPS Test**
- Before deployment, we conduct a 30s test using the Big Buck Bunny mp4. This test will fail if the pipeline does not sustain an average of **at least 5 frames per second (FPS)** during the test.

When creating a workflow that ComfyStream can run, there are a few important considerations:
1. It should be ***fast.***
2. The workflow must have one input (a load image node) and one output (a save image node)
3. When you export the workflow to feed to the ComfyStream interface, it must be exported in API format. Regular workflow files will not work.

Since we are dealing with real-time, speed is a primary focus. You might consider technologies like LCM or Turbo models to keep diffusion fast! Additionally, StreamDiffusion great starting point for advanced workflows.

A simple sample workflow is included in the scripts repo for you to try! It includes a couple of custom nodes developed for use with ComfyStream. This repo was cloned in earlier steps of this document, but you can also find the workflow [here](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RealTimeNodes/tree/main/examples)

Take advantage of the Auto-Queue feature in ComfyUI to get a glimpse of what your workflow will produce.
