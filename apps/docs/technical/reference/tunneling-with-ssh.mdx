## **TURN Server Setup**
#### **When and why is this needed?**

RunPod and many other cloud providers have restrictive network policies that can block direct streaming connections. The TURN server acts as a trusted intermediary that can relay the streaming data between your local machine and the server. Additionally, if direct UDP connections fail (common with corporate/cloud environments), the TURN server can fall back to TCP, making the connection more reliable. To use a TURN server in this set up, follow the steps below:

1. Create a Twilio account at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/en-us)
2. Get credentials from [console.twilio.com](https://console.twilio.com/)
3. Take note of your `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN` for use in the next section of this document

Alternatively you can use [tunneling with SSH](http://localhost:3000/technical/reference/tunneling-with-ssh)

## **Setting up SSH Tunneling**
Tunnel to open up UDP connection

- On the remote server (remote_host), run: 
```bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:4321,fork UDP4:127.0.0.1:5678
```

- On the local machine, Open an SSH tunnel
```bash
 ssh -L 4321:localhost:4321 {remote_user@remote_host and other params from Runpod ssh cmd}
```

- On the local machine, run 
```bash
socat UDP4-LISTEN:1234,fork TCP4:127.0.0.1:4321
```

Traffic sent to localhost:1234 on the local machine will be forwarded over the SSH tunnel and will reach 127.0.0.1:5678 on the remote server

Open another terminal, ssh into the remote SSH terminal:

- You should find "SSH over exposed TCP" value in Runpod
- Copy that command, and `add -L 8889:localhost:8889`
    - For example: `ssh -L 8889:localhost:8889 root@{runpod_ip} -p 16974 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

<Note>
8889 is the port that ComfyStream is listening on at the remote server
