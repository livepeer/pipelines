The [ComfyUI StreamDiffusion](http://localhost:3000/technical/reference/available-nodes#streamdiffusion) custom node supports SD 1.5 models and LoRa checkpoints. LoRas are used to generate a variety of special effects in your workflow, such as color correction, sharpening, and more.


## Configure LoRa checkpoint using ComfyUI
ComfyUI will automatically generate a workflow json file from changes in the LightGraph UI editor. Follow these steps to customize the LoRa checkpoints in your Stream Diffusion workflow:

1. Launch ComfyUI with the StreamDiffusion node installed
2. Choose an example [Stream Diffusion workflow](https://github.com/pschroedl/ComfyUI-StreamDiffusion/tree/main/examples/LoRAs) file that uses LoRas
3. Open the workflow file in ComfyUI
4. Change the `lora_name` input in the workflow to reflect the name of a LoRa checkpoint file you want to use 
5. From ComfyUI, run the workflow to validate the change, save the workflow file when done: **File > Save**
6. Export and download the new workflow json file from ComfyUI: **File > Export > API**

### Checkpoint Files

- **LoRa checkpoints** should be downloaded to `ComfyUI/models/loras`
    - Deployed LoRas are available at [Livepeer-Studio/comfystream_loras](https://huggingface.co/Livepeer-Studio/comfystream_loras/tree/main)

- **SD 1.5 model checkpoints** should be downloaded to `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints`
    - Deployed SD 1.5 models are available at [Livepeer-Studio/comfystream_checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/Livepeer-Studio/comfystream_checkpoints/tree/main)


## Configure LoRa checkpoint in workflow manually

### Changing the LoRa checkpoint
The `lora_name` input will reflect the name of a LoRa file from [Livepeer-Studio/comfystream_loras](https://huggingface.co/Livepeer-Studio/comfystream_loras/tree/main): 
```json
  "178": {
    "inputs": {
      "lora_name": "ral-alienzkin-sd15.safetensors"
    },
    "class_type": "StreamDiffusionCheckpointLoader"
  },
```
Update the `lora_name` input to the name of the LoRa checkpoint you want to use.

### Changing the StreamDiffusion model
LoRas are only compatible with specific SD models. 
If you need to change the model, the `checkpoint` input defines the stable diffusion model (sd_turbo, sd1.5, or a fine-tuned variant) that will be loaded by the workflow:
```json
  "178": {
    "inputs": {
      "checkpoint": "lahmixMysterious_v20.safetensors"
    },
    "class_type": "StreamDiffusionCheckpointLoader"
  },
```
<Info>See [examples/LoRAs/lahmixMysterious_alienzkin_lora_API_FORMAT.json#L15C1-L21C4](https://github.com/pschroedl/ComfyUI-StreamDiffusion/blob/main/examples/LoRAs/lahmixMysterious_alienzkin_lora_API_FORMAT.json#L15C1-L21C4)</Info>

## Submit your LoRa Checkpoint to Livepeer

To request your LoRa checkpoint to be officially deployed on the Livepeer Network:
- Open a pull request to the hugging-face repository [https://huggingface.co/Livepeer-Studio/comfystream_loras](https://huggingface.co/Livepeer-Studio/comfystream_loras/tree/main)
- Open a Pipeline Request ticket with the [Livepeer AI Support Team](#TODO).
